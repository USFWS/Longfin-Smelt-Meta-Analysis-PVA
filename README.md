# Longfin-Smelt-Meta-Analysis-PVA

## Overview
The repository Longfin-Smelt-Meta-Analysis-PVA contains code and a data table to support the paper "Informing Extinction Risk: Summarizing Population Viability through a Meta-analysis of Multiple Long-term Monitoring Programs for a Declining Estuarine Fish Species" (Tobias et al. in press). Earlier versions of this analysis were included as appendices to the Longfin Smelt Species Status Assessment (USFWS 2022).
